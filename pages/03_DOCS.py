## How to Use the Content Creator

1. **Set Preferences**: In the "PREFERENCES" section, input your desired parameters for the generated content. These include the target audience, tone, call to action, length, emotion, and custom hashtags. You can also choose to generate hashtags and create an image for the post.

2. **Subject Input**: Enter the subject of your post in the "Subject" text area.

3. **Generate Post**: Click the "Create Post" button. The application will then generate a post based on your preferences and subject. A progress bar will be displayed while the post is being generated.

4. **Image Generation**: If you chose to create an image, you'll be asked to provide more details about the image. After providing the details and clicking "Create Post", the application will generate an image prompt and use it to generate an image. The generated image will be displayed on the right side of the screen.

5. **Regenerate Image**: If you're not satisfied with the generated image, you can click the "Regenerate image" button to generate a new image using the same prompt.

6. **View Generated Content**: The generated post and image will be displayed on the right side of the screen. You can use this content for your social media posts.

Remember, this tool is designed to assist with content creation, but the generated content should be reviewed and possibly edited before use to ensure it meets your specific needs and complies with the guidelines of the respective social media platform.
